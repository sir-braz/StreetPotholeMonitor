## Frontend Documentation

### Overview
The frontend of the application is built using ReactJS and integrates a geolocation map to display pothole locations. It allows users to register potholes and view them on the map in real-time.

## Design
The design of the frontend follows a clean and modern approach, utilizing the Material-UI library to create a visually appealing and consistent user interface. Material-UI provides a set of pre-built components and styling options based on Google's Material Design guidelines.

- **Typography**: Material-UI offers a variety of typography styles and components for consistent and readable text throughout the application.

- **Layout and Grid**: Material-UI's grid system enables responsive layouts and flexible component positioning, allowing you to create a responsive and adaptive user interface.

- **Color Palette**: Material-UI provides a predefined color palette with primary and secondary colors, making it easy to maintain a consistent color scheme across the application.

- **Components**: Material-UI offers a wide range of ready-to-use components such as buttons, forms, modals, navigation drawers, and more. These components can be customized to match the design requirements of your application.

- **Themes**: Material-UI's theming capabilities allow you to create a custom theme, defining colors, typography, and other visual aspects to ensure a cohesive and branded look and feel.

## Components

The frontend utilizes Material-UI components extensively to build the user interface. Here are some key components used in the application:

- **AppBar**: Provides a persistent navigation header at the top of the screen.

- **Typography**: Used for displaying headings, text content, and other typographic elements.

- **Button**: Enables the creation of interactive buttons for user actions.

- **TextField**: Used for input fields, allowing users to enter data such as latitude, longitude, and descriptions.

- **Snackbar**: Provides feedback messages and notifications to users.

- **Card**: Used to display individual pothole reports with consistent styling.

- **Grid**: Utilized for creating responsive layouts and aligning components.

## Styling

Material-UI allows for flexible styling options to customize the appearance of components. You can leverage Material-UI's styling solution, such as the makeStyles hook or the styled-components approach, to define custom styles that align with your design requirements.

## Dependencies

In addition to React and Material-UI, the frontend may require the following dependencies:

- **react-router-dom**: Enables client-side routing for navigation within the application.
- **axios**: A library for making HTTP requests to interact with the backend API.
- **react-icons**: Provides a vast collection of icons that can be used in various parts of the application.
- **react-hook-form**: A form library for managing form state and validation.
- **yup**: A validation library that integrates well with react-hook-form for form validation.
